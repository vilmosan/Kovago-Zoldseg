# Kővágó-Zöldség
This repository is made for a website which showcases a fictional farming family.

Kővágó = Prefix of village I live in.  
Zöldség = Vegetables in hungarian.

This was actually the **first** web development project of mine.

While I was a doing my internship for my university studies, I've encountered many new technologies which I haven't touched before.
I got huge list from my software engineer mentor about which technologies I should look into to be able to join their live projects.  

This list included many things but the most interested items for me were all related to front-end web development:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- Bootstrap 4

With these technologies I had so much joy in creating RESPONSIVE, visually appealing and very useful front-end applications for the company. This was the time I had an idea of making my first fictional website of something that has some connection to me.
It was the summer of '19 and my family was growing vegetables in the garden so that is where the inspiration came from.  

I also owe a lot to Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) who kept me very interested in the world of web development.
This project's base was one of his videos where he was teaching Bootstrap 4.  

I think I'll always look back on this project with great pleasure years down the line in my programming career.
